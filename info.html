        Hello, I’m Pietro Vitali, I was born in Modena (Italy) in 1997 and now I
        am working in Switzerland. After concluding my bachelor degree in
        Communication Design at the Politecnico di Milano in 2019, I moved to
        Baselto obtain my master degree in Visual Communication at HGK Basel
        School of Design. Mediation, narration and artworks accessibility are
        strongly present in my research and practice. Art communication is my
        main interest, which was also explored in my master thesis concerning
        Art Documentation. The production of content –especially digital– is
        throughly mastered in my latest academic and professional experience.
        This portfolio is structured in order to recognize my general projects’
        attitude, presenting nine works I’ve developed personally or in
        teamwork. I tend to work with a strong Research Approach, combining
        Artistic research and Design Thinking. Creative direction and
        coordinament are two main parts of my working method. Due to academic
        studies and personal inclinations, I researched mainly on Visual Images,
        Gender Studies, Preservation, Conservation and Curatorship, which are
        trasversally presented into the works in this portfolio.
