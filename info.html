        <p style="columns: 2 250px;">Hello, I’m Pietro Vitali, I was born in Modena in 1997 but I'm currently working in Milan. I graduated in Communication Design at the Politecnico di Milano in 2019.
Thanks to my academic studies, I was able to deepen and improve several aspects of my current design, such as Photography, Fashion, Editorial Design, and Architecture. During my studies, I was able to convey those interests through my personal, professional, and academic projects.
<br>This portfolio is structured in order to recognize my general projects’ attitude, presenting eight works I’ve developed personally or in teamwork.
<br>I consider my working approach to be based on strong research with the aim of exploring design transversally into different media, visual languages and outputs.
