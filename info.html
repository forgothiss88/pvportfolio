            <p style="columns: 2 250px;">Hello, I’m Pietro Vitali, I was born in Modena in 1997 but I'm currently
                working in Milan. I graduated in Communication Design at the Politecnico di Milano in 2019.
                Thanks to my academic studies, I was able to deepen and improve several aspects of my current design,
                such as Photography, Fashion, Editorial Design, and Architecture. During my studies, I was able to
                convey those interests through my personal, professional, and academic projects.
                <br>This portfolio is structured in order to recognize my general projects’ attitude, presenting eight
                works I’ve developed personally or in teamwork.
                <br>I consider my working approach to be based on strong research with the aim of exploring design
                transversally into different media, visual languages and outputs.
