                Hello, I’m Pietro Vitali, I was born in Modena (Italy) in 1997. I hold a
                Bachelor degree in Communication Design from the Politecnico di Milano,
                class of 2019, and I am currently concluding a Master’s degree in Visual
                Communication at the FHNW in Basel. Through my academic studies, I've
                been able to deepen and improve several aspects of my current design,
                namely Photography, Fashion, Editorial Design, and Architecture. I am
                presently highly interested in Visual Research, meaning researching
                through visual media the potentiality of images, specifically how and
                why they can convey messages. This portfolio is structured to recognize
                my general projects’ approach, presenting nine works I’ve developed
                personally or in teamwork. I tend to work with a strong Research
                Approach, combining Artistic Research and Design Thinking. Creative
                direction and coordination are two main parts of my working method. Due
                to academic studies and personal inclinations, I do research mainly on
                Visual Images, Gender Studies, Preservation, Conservation, and
                Curatorship, which are trasversally presented throughout the works
                presented in this portfolio.
