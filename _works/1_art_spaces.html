Art Spaces - An archived mind map of exhibition experiences - is an editorial
design project with the aim of collecting, archiving, and making accessible all
the exhibitions I visited in Switzerland during 10 months. The process
considered analyzing the exhibitions, archiving their material and immaterial
knowledge, organizing the design reflecting on both the material and immaterial
contents. As result, Art Spaces consists of two different format leaflets-
representing the primary and secondary content of each exhibition - that can be
connected among themselves using diagonal folding methods.
