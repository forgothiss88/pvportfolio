The project briefing was a critical research on a specific photograph of each student’s choice.
The result is a short editorial design representing a monograph of controversial photographer Andres Serrano.
The study analyzes his works from his most contentious photograph “Piss Christ”, studying his philosophy and attitude.
The editorial product aim was to try to help re-evaluate the artist who most of the time was superficially criticized and censored.
