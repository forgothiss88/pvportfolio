"As I Am" is a short movie that was selected as part of the 47th Schweizer Jugendfilmtage 
and screened in Zurich on March 24th, 2022. Shot in Neuchâtel (CH) in 2021, 
this documentary music video follows the leading character Carlos Valencia 
as he performs his original poems and prose. Despite being shot over just 
two days during a summer workshop, the introspective content is delivered 
through the actor's charisma and the emotional depth of the photography, 
which vividly portrays the protagonist's life through his own words. 
The outcome is profound and sincere, yet it also sparks joy and hope.
The poems and proses are original texts by Carlos Valencia.
