The design installation Chitchat, exposed at Base in March 2019, was born from the project named “What Makes Humans
Human?”. The original brief was to create a speculative design installation that would answer the question while
stimulating reflection on the keyword: gossip. The concept’s target is to re-evaluate the practice of gossiping, which
social and evolutionary importance is often ignored.
The installation consists of a floating labyrinth from which one exits by the guidance of audio messages sent to each
user’s phone on the Telegram app. The project developed components are divided into: visual identity, coding, and
structural-physical part.
Through a varied sign system available digitally through Telegram and analogically through stickers, we were able to
convey the visual concept of the installation.
The coding part was mainly carried out through a Telegram Bot, an automation that was able to interact with the users at
the installation through vocal messages and was also able to change the plot according to the users’ answers.
Finally, we designed a labyrinth structure that provides users an immersive experience, where they genuinely felt
disoriented and seeking a way out.
