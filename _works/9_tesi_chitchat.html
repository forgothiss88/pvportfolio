The “Chitchat - an interactive experience to re-evaluate gossip” project is the editorial design thesis regarding the Chitchat installation. It analyzes all the stages of the design of the exhibition project, from the ideation of the concept, the designing of the visual identity, the interaction with the users, to the structure designing.
Therefore the thesis aims to highlight both the theoretical and practical processes of the installation design, using visual expedients related to the Chitchat visual identity, like a solid yellow background for several pages, or handwritten-like signs to point out particular words. The last contact between the two elements is the thesis dust cover, obtained from the installation walls.

The project briefing was a critical research on a specific Photograph of student’s choice.
The result is a short editorial design representing a monograph of the controversial photograph Andres Serrano.
The work analyzes his works from his most contentious photograph “Piss Christ”, studying his philosophy and his attitude.
The editorial product aim was trying to help re-evaluating the artist who most of the time was superficially criticized and censored
