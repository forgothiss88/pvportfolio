Museums, galleries, cultural institutions, and art centres represent a shield
from the outside world and yet a magnifying mirror of reality. Many realms
coexist to create a galaxy of different stories, thoughts, concepts, and
perspectives which inspired this research. This thesis aims to critically
investigate the practice of documentation through the standpoint that an artwork
acquires meaning and endurance thanks to its documentation. Even when the works
of art are not physically or temporarily accessible, their documentation can
bring them alive. Art documentation is practically explored through the making
of videos, which aim at finding a possible visual representation of the
artwork’s identity, beyond its mere appearance. Following this method, I
documented the public sculpture Lieu Dit by Michael Grosserts (1976); the
painting View to infinity by Ferdinand Hodler (1913); the art installation
Enclosure (When the sick rule the world reverb) by Ruth Buchanan (2019–2022);
the web–art mouchette.org by Martine Neddam (1996); the performance Bouncing in
the Corner No.1 by Bruce Nauman (1968); the painting Lächelnd by Miriam Cahn
(1997); the art installation Untitled by Heimo Zobernig (1997). The outcomes
resulting from the documentation are departure points to reflect on the limits
of presentation and preservation practices, and to consider possible
alternatives to overcome them. This research contributes to reframing the
discourse around the preservation and presentation of artworks, investigating
documentation as the tool to avoid the objectifying strive for truth of
conventional practices. Giving back to the research subjectivity and tenderness,
the project allows art discourses to focus on diverse perspectives, experiences,
and most importantly, on life.
