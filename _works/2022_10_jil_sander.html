The project briefing presented a creative challenge that required a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the brand's identity. As I studied the series of photographs provided, I quickly realized that the main objective was to capture the essence of the Jil Sander Beauty Line in a way that was both visually appealing and conceptually relevant. With this in mind, I began to envision a series of images that would showcase the brand's signature style and aesthetic, while also pushing the boundaries of traditional advertising.
Drawing inspiration from the works of renowned photographers Mario Sorrenti and Nobuyoshi Araki, I set out to create a series of images that focused on different parts of the human body. However, I intentionally avoided any references to race or gender, as I wanted the emphasis to be on the perceptive characteristics of the skin. By doing so, I was able to convey a universal message that spoke to the brand's core values of inclusivity and diversity.
As I continued to develop the concept, I carefully crafted each image to showcase the Jil Sander Beauty Line in a unique and captivating way. From the lighting and composition to the models and styling, every element was carefully considered and executed to perfection. Ultimately, I was able to deliver a series of photographs that not only met the client's brief but also exceeded their expectations. The images successfully captured the essence of the Jil Sander Beauty Line, and left a lasting impression on viewers
