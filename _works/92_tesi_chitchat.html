The “Chitchat - an interactive experience to re-evaluate gossip” project is the editorial design thesis regarding the
Chitchat installation. It analyzes all the stages of the design of the exhibition project, from the ideation of the
concept, the designing of the visual identity, the interaction with the users, to the structure designing.
Therefore the thesis aims to highlight both the theoretical and practical processes of the installation design, using
visual expedients related to the Chitchat visual identity, like a solid yellow background for several pages, or
handwritten-like signs to point out particular words. The last contact between the two elements is the thesis dust
cover, obtained from the installation walls.
