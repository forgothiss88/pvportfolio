“As I Am” is a short movie shot in Neuchâtel (CH) in 2021. The documentary music
video follows the leading character Carlos Valencia performing his poems and
proses. The introspective content is delivered by the actor's charisma and by
the emotional depth of the photography, which vividly portrays the protagonist’s
life through his own words. The project lasted two weeks since it was carried
out during a summer workshop, with two days of shooting. The outcome results
profound and sincere, and yet it sparks joy and hope. The poems and proses are
original texts by Carlos Valencia.
