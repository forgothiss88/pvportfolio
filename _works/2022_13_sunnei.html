During my internship at SUNNEI, I had the opportunity to collaborate on various 
creative direction projects that included brand design, digital communication, 
and content creation for both digital and analog platforms. I was involved 
in planning and executing the editorial schedule for social media, 
creating and managing digital content for the brand's e-commerce, 
and designing editorial content to promote SUNNEI's flagship store. 
Additionally, I contributed to the planning of the SS2020 and FW2021 shows, 
working closely with the communication team to ensure a cohesive and impactful 
message for the brand.
