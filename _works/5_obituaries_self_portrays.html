The project consists of a visual exploration of the meaning of Death, using
obituaries to self-represent my death. The visual experiments using the medium
of moving images condense and discuss the conventionality of images when it
comes to representing Death, and how faith and religion could influence these
images. The project research question that led the experiments consists of an
agglomerate of inquiries ranging from the role of Death in the macro natural
process of life, to what a dead person leaves behind when they pass away.
Spanning from macro to micro scale, from personal to shared inquiries. The
research projects consist of practical and theoretical investigations, combining
art research and scientific writing.
