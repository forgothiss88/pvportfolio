Curators' statement:
It would have been easy to applaud the artworks exhibited as a new critical
departure from the –almost– too conventional way of seeing queer art. Yet, the
greatness of this exhibition lies in the actual absence of greatness. This does
not claim that these works are not excellent nor that nothing or nobody is truly
special, but rather we understand that all moments, all experiences, all types
of joy, and disappointments are equally relevant or even equally insignificant.
They all “coalesce like paint or photographic chemicals into the image of a
life, and that is good enough”. We instead praise the manifold and complex
beauty of queer and feminist art as objects themselves of criticism. They want
us to question our understanding of art/life by simply being confronted with
radical or intimate points of view. They critically ask to be critiqued. For
this reason, we ask to dwell within them as they are, to take them home and
fight with them; make peace with them or not. The sentimentalist tendency would
negate the possibility of criticism of queer objects, due to their marginalized
birth. In turn, by simply allowing these artworks to be seen as they are,
fragile or invulnerable, they conquer respect and intimacy. The untouchable
artwork desires to be hugged. The delicate task of curating a queer exhibition
also consisted of gathering queer perspectives under the same roof. Who are we
to decide anyone’s queerness? Or to which degree queerness is manifested in
their work. Lust*Art finds its beginning here, in the critical space where queer
sensibilities lie, where we acknowledge our limits as curators deciding that the
power of queer art lies in this precise spot of its vulnerability. We are not
framing queerness, but we are embracing its diverseness with pride.
