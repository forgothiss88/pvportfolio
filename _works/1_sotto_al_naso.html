The project brief was to design a publishing product that reflected Milan as a melting pot of different cities within one unique environment, conceiving a critical point of view of the metropolis.
The project is based on the central subject of Historical Shops, described with a Photograph Reportage and Interviews of the owners.
The formal expedient used is designing a Magazine to better represent the dynamic nature of the Shops, and naming the publishing product “Under the Nose”, imagining a quarterly magazine where each issue is dedicated to a different hidden reality that we usually have under our nose, without noticing it.
