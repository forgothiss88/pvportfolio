The project is composed by two main components. A visual essay developed during
the course at the University of Basel named Engendering the City, held by Aylin
Vildirim Tschoepe . Together with the installation design project in
collaboration with Moritz Mader, Anna Zweifel, Jeannine Schmidhauser. The visual
essay composed by images and a text-based essay investigate the correlation
between public statues and their grade of abstraction. It wants to explore if
and how statues are gendered by the public and if this attitude implies a
different emotional embodiment in the encounters. The chairsâ€™ design was
developed in order to create a common layout for all the visual essays developed
during the course.
