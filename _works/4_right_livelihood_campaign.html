The project goal was to design the art direction campaign of the Right
Livelihood association. The Right Livelihood Award recognizes the actions of
brave visionaries and builds impactful connections around the world, which
boosts urgent and long-term social change. The creative direction focused on
building a visual coherence that enhances the value of humanity, community, and
connection. Using the metaphor of holding and supporting each other to visually
represent the institutional values, the campaign develops posters and leaflets
designed for the Award Ceremony, Website re-design, and Instagram.
