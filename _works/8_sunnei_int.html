During my internship at SUNNEI I had the possibility to collaborate on several creative direction projects that range from the creation of both digital and analogical content to the planning of the SS2020 and FW2021 shows.
The works were followed transversely by the communication team, allowing everyone to express themselves and contribute to the final work. The projects I’ve participated in the most are: creation and management of digital content for the brand’s e-commerce, planning, and creating the editorial schedule for social media as well as designing editorial content to promote SUNNEI’s very first flagship store.
