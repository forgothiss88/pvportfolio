This editorial design is developed based on the thorough study of theatrical posters throughout different ages. Taking as cases of study the most important Opera Theatres all over the world.
The visual expedients used to enhance every different Theatre are using a different color for each chapter, and the study of two theatres manifestoes of different ages through a printed transparent paper overlapped to a normal page.
