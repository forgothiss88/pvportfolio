Representation of the idea of memory: A design research through practice. What
could the representation of the idea of memory be? Is there a way of
representing memory universally? The project developed a visual research with
the aim of reflecting upon a possible representation of the concept of Memory,
creating “memory scapes”. The images proved to be successful in the
representation of memories and the elicitation of them. The process aimed to
decontextualize personal memories (all the pictures were personal photos) and to
create a shared image, valid for the viewers. The balance between the tangible
memory and the abstractness creates the substance for the research.
