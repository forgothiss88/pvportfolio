The project briefing consisted of a series of photographs with a commercial aim.
Trying to respect the brief, I imagined shooting the commercial advertising for a Jil Sander Beauty Line, infusing the brandâ€™s essence into five photographs.
Inspired by Mario Sorrenti and Nobuyoshi Araki, the advertising portrayed different parts of the human body, intentionally eluding any race or gender reference, and setting the attention to the perceptive characteristic of the skin.
