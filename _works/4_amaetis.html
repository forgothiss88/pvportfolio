Amætis is a Place Branding project, which brief was to create a brand for an imaginary planet. My team and I started from Gianluca Baldi’s Novel “Pianeta-a-Metà”, describing an entire planet full of half things. Then we designed a liveable imaginary experience on the planet and its visual coordinate concept.
So was born Amætis, the planet’s brand, where it’s possible to take a spiritual journey.
Based on a Brand Manual and a Brand Book, the communication project is composed of the study of the brand’s logo and the application of it on different outputs.
